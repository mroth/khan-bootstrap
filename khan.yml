# Sets up a *minimal* dev environment for KA developers (or just me)
#
# Goal is to be extremely sensitive to trying to keep the KA stuff isolated from
# everything else, for devs who do a lot of open source development, you might
# not want KA specific things in global githook templates, for example, which
# was the first thing I spotted.
#
# This is similar to what khan-dotfiles does, with slightly different design
# goals informing it:
#  - Don't do any "preferences", let the user manage their own dotfiles
#  - Only add dependencies, not shortcuts (can add those manually as I want them)
#  - more...
#
# Note to KA devs: Like the rest of bootslap, this is Mac-only for now, but
# could be made generic with not too much effort.
